        <h2>Sketch like an Architect: Techniques and Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Simplify Your Tools [00:00:54]:</strong> Limit your tool set to just a few items to focus on the drawing itself. Sketching is about visual thinking and hunting for ideas, not creating a final presentation [00:01:18].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Master Line Work and Overlapping [00:02:21]:</strong> Architectural style is primarily defined by its line work. When lines intersect at corners, always overlap them; this allows you to move quickly and often looks more finished [00:02:30].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Confident Strokes [00:02:56]:</strong> Try to use single, continuous, confident strokes instead of a series of dashes. A slight waver is acceptable and is part of the architectural style.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Layering Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use directional hash marks for shading, building textures, and suggesting surfaces to create depth [00:03:13].</li>
                    <li>Employ construction or layout lines (in light pencil or blue) to guide your drawing and set the basic proportions [00:03:36]. Layering your finished drawing on top of these lines creates the loose, sketchy aesthetic [00:04:02].</li>
                    <li>Utilize a full complement of line types including solid lines, different line weights, dashed lines (to indicate surfaces above or below), and center lines [00:04:19].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Improving Lettering [00:05:21]:</strong> If you struggle with architectural lettering, try writing smaller and slower. Use layout and construction lines to set line heights, making the guidelines even smaller than your letter forms to help tidy them up.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Overcome Creative Blocks [00:06:14]:</strong> If you are stuck or unhappy with a sketch, try changing your media or implements (e.g., pen to colored pencil, white paper to toned paper). This can unlock new ideas and make the work feel fresh.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice Daily [00:06:59]:</strong> Practicing even for 15 to 30 minutes a day is the one thing guaranteed to improve your technique.
            </li>
        </ul>
