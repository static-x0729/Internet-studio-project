        <h2>Core Concepts and Techniques for Gouache Painting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>What is Gouache? [00:00:05]:</strong> Gouache is a water-based medium, often described as opaque watercolor. It can be used thinly and transparently or thickly and opaquely by adding less water [00:00:11].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Key Properties and Workflow:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Opacity:</strong> You can work from light-to-dark or dark-to-light, as you can paint light colors opaquely over dark areas [00:00:29]. This makes it more forgiving of mistakes [00:00:39].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Reactivation:</strong> Gouache is resoluble, meaning dried paint on the paper or palette can be reactivated with a wet brush, allowing you to return to a painting later [00:00:46].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Drying Shift (Practice Needed):</strong> Gouache dries to a matte finish, but colors shift in value: light colors dry darker, and dark colors dry lighter [00:01:21].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Materials Checklist:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Paint:</strong> Gouache typically comes in tubes and is best used fresh and creamy [00:01:55].</li>
                    <li><strong>Paper:</strong> Watercolor or mixed-media paper (300 gsm is ideal) that can handle water. Cold-pressed paper is preferred for a bit of texture [00:02:11].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Brushes:</strong> Synthetic watercolor or mixed-media brushes are great, especially those with long bristles that hold a lot of water [00:02:40].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> A palette, water, a paper towel, and a spray bottle to mist your paint and keep it creamy while working [00:03:34].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistency (Creamy is Key):</strong> The goal is to mix paint to a smooth, creamy consistency that is opaque [00:04:30]. Add water slowly until the paint spreads smoothly without leaving a streaky, dry-brush texture [00:04:20].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Layering (Thin to Thick):</strong> The basic rule is to work from thin, diluted layers to thicker, more opaque layers [00:05:41]. This prevents you from accidentally lifting the under-layer of paint.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Blending:</strong> Blending is best done while the paint has that creamy consistency [00:08:40]. You can blend two colors together by meeting them in the middle or gradually mixing the second color into the first on your palette and pulling it down [00:08:16].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Lifting/Fixing Mistakes:</strong> Because gouache is resoluble, you can re-wet a mistake with a wet brush and gently soak up the excess pigment with a tissue to lift the color [00:06:31].</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Glazing:</strong> Use paint that is heavily thinned with water (transparent) to gently apply a glaze of color over a dried layer without lifting the pigment beneath [00:09:54].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
