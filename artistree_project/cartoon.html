        <h2>Learn to Draw a Cute Cartoon Character:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sketching the Basic Form [00:00:44]:</strong> Begin with a large circle or oval for the head. Add a small neck and a triangular body to create a simplified shape, exaggerating the head for a classic cartoon look.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Drawing the Clothing and Lower Body [00:00:56]:</strong> Draw the collar (almost like a heart shape) and taper the legs inward, keeping them close together for a simple style [00:01:29]. Finish the lower body with high socks [00:01:43].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Establishing Facial Proportions [00:02:14]:</strong> Set a center line and a low eye line for a cute effect. Give the character almond-shaped eyes and ensure the pupils are consistently placed for a unified gaze [00:02:51].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Creating Facial Features [00:03:04]:</strong> Add big eyelashes, a small, upturned nose, and a simple curved line for the mouth (no lips or shadows) [00:03:27]. Bring the eyebrows in closer to the eyes than in real life to enhance the cute look [00:03:37].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Adding Hair and Details [00:03:50]:</strong> Build up the hair to increase the head's size. Include rounded bangs and show the pigtails coming out behind the head, overlapped by the main head shape [00:04:20]. Complete the figure with a simple, mitten-type hand holding a purse [00:04:46].
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Inking and Finalizing [00:05:06]:</strong> Start by darkening the eyes to establish personality. Use a thick line on the side of the face to emphasize the simple, defined graphic shape of the character [00:05:48]. Add a final line for the ground [00:07:35].
            </li>
        </ul>
