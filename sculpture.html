  <h1>What is Sculpture?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Sculpture is a three-dimensional art form that focuses on shaping materials into physical forms and structures. Unlike drawing or painting, sculpture exists in real space, meaning viewers can walk around it, observe it from different angles, and experience its presence in a more interactive way. Sculptors use form, texture, scale, and physical movement to bring their ideas to life, creating anything from realistic figures to abstract shapes. Because sculpture takes up space and has mass, it allows artists to explore depth and dimension in a way that other art forms cannot. <strong>Click the icon at the top left to access our library of sculpture tutorials.</strong></p>

  <p>Sculpture can be made from a huge variety of materials, each offering its own creative possibilities. Traditional materials include clay, stone, wood, and metal, all of which can be shaped, carved, or molded in different ways. Modern sculptors also experiment with plastics, found objects, fabric, wire, or even everyday items. Tools such as carving knives, chisels, pottery wheels, kilns, welding equipment, and armatures help artists shape and support their work. The materials chosen often influence the style and final look of the piece, whether it’s smooth and polished, rough and textured, lightweight, or heavy and monumental.</p>

  <p>There are many types of sculpture, ranging from carved stone pieces to cast metal statues, hand-built clay objects, and large-scale installations. Pottery focuses on shaping clay into functional or decorative vessels. Techniques like wheel throwing, slab-building, coiling, and slip-casting allow artists to form pots, bowls, sculptures, and ceramic artworks with different textures and levels of precision. In other forms of sculpture, artists might carve wood or stone, mold clay, weld metal, or construct pieces using mixed media. Each technique requires a different approach: carving removes material to reveal a form, modeling adds material to build a shape, casting creates multiples from a mold, and assembling puts various materials together into a single structure.</p>
  
  <p>Sculpture and pottery both allow for a huge range of creative expression, whether the goal is realism, abstraction, functionality, or experimentation. Because they involve hands-on processes and physical materials, these art forms give artists a unique connection to the work they create. Whether shaping clay on a wheel, carving into a block of wood, or constructing something entirely unexpected, sculpture offers endless opportunities to explore texture, form, and the physical world.</p>
